# YOLO_car_detection
car detection in photos and videos

Before running video_car_detector.py make sure that:
    1) INPUT_FILE holds the path to the input photo/video
    2) OUTPUT_FILE holds the path and the name you wish for the output file (VIDEO MUST BE '*.avi'!)
    3) LABELS_FILE holds the path to the list of labels
    4) CONFIG_FILE holds the path to the configuration file ('*.cfg')
    5) WEIGHTS_FILE holds the path to the weights file ('*.weights')

In the video detection, it is possible to stop the program while running by pressing 'q' and getting a partial video as output.
